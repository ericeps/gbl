This is a clone of the game Freeway.

The goal of this game is to get the chicken to the other side of the road.

When one makes it to the other side your score will increase and another chicken will appear again at the bottom of the screen.

In novice mode, when a chicken is hit by a car it will fly backwards to the lane before it.  In expert mode, the chicken will appear all the way at the beginning of the road.

There is a time limit.  When the time ends in two player mode the player with the most points will win.
